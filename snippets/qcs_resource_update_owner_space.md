# Updating owners and spaces on objects

This page documents how to change the owner and space properties on different resource types. 

Apologies, a bit of variety in tooling and languages below.

## Object types and coverage

GUI and API availability varies per resource type in SaaS.

| Resource Type | Change owner via GUI | Change owner via API | Change space via GUI | Change space via API |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Apps | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| App Objects | No | No | N/A | N/A |
| Data Connections | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| Data Files | No | ? | No | Yes |
| Spaces | Yes | Yes | N/A | N/A |


## App Objects

### Change owner via GUI

This is not currently possible.

### Change owner via API

This is not currently possible, as the object owner can't updated via the items API.

It is possible to script the rebuild of objects (using unbuild/ build) and impersonation (using JWT).

## Data Connections

### Change owner via GUI

Navigate to Management console > Data content, and there is an option to "move" any data connection (go to https://{hostname}.{region}.qlikcloud.com/console/content/data-connections)

### Change owner via API

The `/actions/update` endpoint allows you to replace both or either the owner or space of an app:

```
curl -L -X POST 'https://{hostname}.{region}.qlikcloud.com/api/v1/data-connections/actions/update' \
-H 'Authorization: Bearer {token}' \
-H 'Content-type: application/json' \
-H 'Accept: application/json' \
--data-raw '{
    "connections": [
        {
            "id": "{data connection id}",
            "ownerId": "{new data connection owner id}"
        }
    ]
}'
```

### Change space via GUI

Navigate to Management console > Data content, and there is an option to "move" any data connection (go to https://{hostname}.{region}.qlikcloud.com/console/content/data-connections)

### Change space via API

The new way of changing the space via API is using the `/actions/update` endpoint, and a call like the following:

```
curl -L -X POST 'https://{hostname}.{region}.qlikcloud.com/api/v1/data-connections/actions/update' \
-H 'Authorization: Bearer {token}' \
-H 'Content-type: application/json' \
-H 'Accept: application/json' \
--data-raw '{
    "connections": [
        {
            "id": "{data connection id}",
            "spaceId": "{target space id}",
            "spaceType": "{personal|shared|managed}"
        }
    ]
}'
```

The old way of doing this is below, in a powershell snippet:

```
# Script to do this in native PS as qlik CLI seems a bit buggy on this endpoint

# Define your tenant URL
$tenant = "tenant.region.qlikcloud.com"

# Define your API key
$apikey = "myapikey"

# Define your data connection ID
$dataconnid = "id of the data connection"

# Define your target space
$space = "id of the target space"

# Dummy value for the headers
$hdrs = @{}

# Add in the API key to the headers
$hdrs.Add("Authorization","Bearer $($apikey)")

# Handle TLS 1.2 only environments
[Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol = [Net.SecurityProtocolType]'Ssl3,Tls,Tls11,Tls12' 

# Get the Data Connection Info
$dataconn = Invoke-WebRequest -Method Get -Uri "https://$($tenant)/api/v1/data-connections/$($dataconnid)" -Headers $hdrs | ConvertFrom-Json

# Create the payload for updating the data connection
$payload = @{
        "qId"               = $dataconn.qId
        "qName"             = $dataconn.qName
        "qConnectStatement" = $dataconn.qConnectStatement
        "qType"             = $dataconn.qType
        "qEngineObjectID"   = $dataconn.qEngineObjectID
        "space"             = $space
    } | ConvertTo-Json
$payload = ConvertTo-Json $payload 

# Send the post request to update the data connection
$dataconnresp = Invoke-WebRequest -Method put -Uri "https://$($tenant)/api/v1/data-connections/$($dataconnid)" -Headers $hdrs -Body $payload
```

## Spaces

### Change owner via GUI

This can be done from the QMC at https://{tenant}.{region}.qlikcloud.com/console/spaces/

### Change owner via API

This is simple and requires just the ID for the space and the user who will own the resource.
```
qlik space update {spaceId} --ownerId {userId}

example:
qlik space update 6176c4aae25328b217e952e2 --ownerId oVtOVXb4qg1oXZn7nF-LSh960MUnetxN
```
